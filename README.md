# Unity ECS with navmesh and MapBox

A demo implementation of Unity Entity Component System with NavMesh and [MapBox Unity](https://www.mapbox.com/unity/) SDK.

I'm getting around 40-50 FPS with 100,000 entities traversing the navmesh.

Required Unity version 2018.1 or newer to run with the Scripting Runtime Version set to .NET 4.0 and the ECS packages installed.
